MRS Basis Set Conversion Toolbox version 1.0.0


<h1>Overview</h1>
The MRS Basis Set Conversion Toolbox allows users to convert their basis sets for usage across any fitting tool. This gives the user the flexibility to generate a basis set using any software package and then convert it to a format based on the fitting/ quantifaction software of choice. The user is no longer confined to a fitting/ quantifaction tool based on the format of the basis set.

<h1>Installation Requirements</h1>
Prerequisites (Python >= 3.9, tkinter), mat73, nibabel, spec2nii. All can be downloaded by running the requirements.txt file using the command below.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<h1>Usage</h1>
Once you have cloned or downloaded the repository, all that is required to launch the gui is typing the following command in terminal.

```bash
python main.py
```

<h1>MATLAB Helper Scripts</h1>
save_spinach_basis.m -> for SpinWizard/Spinach users
save_marss_basis.m —> for MARSS/INSPECTOR visualization


<h1>Sample Basis Sets</h1>
A sample basis set from each tool is included in the "sample_basis_sets" folder. These should all work as I ran them all through the different fitting tools.
